/*
 * test_large_wal_concurrency — exercises large_wal's segment locking.
 *
 * Every other large_wal test drives one thread. That was honest while
 * LargeWalWriter was the only thing touching these structures, but it
 * means the locks added for the archiver have nothing proving them.
 * This file used to FABRICATE the concurrency the LARGE_WAL Archiver
 * thread would later supply for real, running its own hand-rolled
 * driver. That thread now exists (large_wal_archiver.c) and
 * large_wal_manager_init starts it, so these are the real threads:
 * readers racing the writer, readers racing the archiver relocating and
 * freeing segments underneath them, and the writer racing the archiver
 * over the same rotation slot.
 *
 * That distinction matters for what a clean detector run is worth. With
 * a hand-rolled driver, a detector could only vouch for the paths the
 * test itself chose to walk; the writer-vs-archiver lock ordering had
 * to be argued from reading the code, because nothing called copy_out.
 * Now the real thread is the one being watched.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: passing here is necessary but nowhere near sufficient. A
 * data race usually produces correct output until the day it doesn't, so
 * the actual verification is running this under ThreadSanitizer:
 *
 *     cmake -B build-tsan -DMYDB_SANITIZE_THREAD=ON && \
 *         cmake --build build-tsan && \
 *         MYDB_CONCURRENCY_SCALE=20 ./build-tsan/tests/test_large_wal_concurrency
 *
 * Where TSan's runtime isn't installed, valgrind's Helgrind catches the
 * same race and lock-order-inversion classes on the ordinary build:
 *
 *     MYDB_CONCURRENCY_SCALE=40 valgrind --tool=helgrind \
 *         --history-level=none ./build/tests/test_large_wal_concurrency
 *
 * A clean detector run is the pass condition. A green run without one
 * only says nothing crashed this time.
 *
 * MYDB_CONCURRENCY_SCALE divides the workload. Both tools instrument
 * every single lock operation, so the default workload would take hours
 * under them — and piling up iterations is not what a detector needs
 * anyway. It reports a race the first time two threads reach the same
 * unguarded byte, so covering each path a handful of times is worth as
 * much as covering it a million times.

 * points at the rotation slot (claim_next put it there) and copy_out
 * therefore has to open the holding-area file and repoint.
 *
 * After a real crash the process is gone, so recovery runs the other
 * branch: archiver_init's scan has already registered the holding-area
 * file, and copy_out must notice that and free the slot WITHOUT
 * repointing anything. Getting that wrong would leak the scan's fd, or
 * worse, aim the registry at a slot that is about to be zeroed.
 *
 * This is also the only test where the archiver THREAD does the
 * recovery on its own, with nobody calling copy_out by hand.
