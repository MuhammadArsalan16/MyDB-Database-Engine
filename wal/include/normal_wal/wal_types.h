/*
 * wal_types.h — WAL record header + fixed-shape record body layouts
 * (MYDB_WAL_DESIGN.md §8.3/§8.4, MYDB_WAL_IMPLEMENTATION.md §8.2/§8.5,
 * §8.7, §10.5).
 *
 * WalRecordHeader is wal/'s own struct (unlike WalRecType, which is
 * system-wide and lives in common.h — see the comment there for why the
 * split falls where it does).
 *
 * These structs are plain (not __attribute__((packed))), matching how
 * every other on-disk struct in this codebase works: the struct is a
 * convenience for callers to fill in field-by-field, not a layout the
 * code memcpy's onto disk directly. The real wire format is expressed by
 * wal_segment.c's serialize/deserialize functions, which read/write each
 * field at its own explicit byte offset (WAL_PAGE_HEADER_CHECKSUM_OFFSET
 * etc.) — the same *_OFFSET-constant pattern database_file.c/partition.c/
 * schema_file.c already use. So sizeof(WalRecordHeader) etc. is not
 * asserted anywhere to equal the documented on-disk byte count.
 *
 * WAL_REC_INSERT / WAL_REC_DELETE bodies are genuinely variable-length
 * (slot_no, row_len, row_bytes) and are not given a struct here — they're
 * packed by hand at the call site, the same way every other
 * variable-length row body in this codebase is.

 * Serialize/deserialize + checksum. Added in Phase 3 (wal_ring_buffer.c
 * is the first real consumer) — deferred out of Phase 1 since there was
 * no file/frame I/O yet to serialize into.
 *
 * Unlike WalPageHeader/WalSegmentHeader (checksum over the header's own
 * fixed bytes only), WalRecordHeader.checksum covers header AND body —
 * two regions that are not contiguous in the final on-disk layout
 * (checksum itself sits between them, at header offset 40). Both
 * functions build a small scratch buffer (header-minus-checksum ++
 * body) purely to compute one CRC32 over that combined span, then write
 * the real fixed layout (header incl. checksum at its own offset,
 * followed by body) into buf. buf must have room for
 * WAL_RECORD_HEADER_SIZE + body_len bytes; body_len must be <=
 * WAL_MAX_ROW_BODY (the scratch buffer is sized for the worst case).
 *
 * wal_record_header_serialize fills buf and stamps hdr->checksum too, so
 * callers who need to inspect what was written (e.g. to know a frame's
 * new end_lsn) can read it straight back off *hdr without re-parsing buf.
 * Caller sets every field of *hdr except checksum first.
 *
 * wal_record_header_deserialize validates the checksum before filling
 * *out. Returns MYDB_OK or MYDB_ERR_BAD_CHECKSUM.
