/*
 * wal_segment_pool.h — the pool of WAL_SEGMENT_POOL_SLOTS physical
 * wal_<N>.mydb segment files: pre-allocation, round-robin claiming, raw
 * page I/O within a claimed slot, and the crash-reload tail-scan
 * (MYDB_WAL_IMPLEMENTATION.md §8.4).
 *
 * WalSlot (the in-memory runtime handle — fd + cached header) lives here,
 * not in wal_segment.h, which now covers only the on-disk WalSegmentHeader
 * *format*. This module is the pool/runtime concern.
 *
 * Interface discipline: WalSegmentPool/WalSlot are transparent structs
 * (visible fields, stack-constructible, easy to test) — the same shape
 * BufferPool (storage_engine/include/buffer_pool.h) already uses in this
 * codebase. But exactly like BufferPool, nothing outside this module's
 * own .c file is meant to touch pool->slots[i] fields directly. Every
 * future consumer goes through the wal_segment_pool_*() functions below
 * only — in particular, two consumers this phase doesn't build yet but
 * whose access pattern shapes what's exposed here:
 *
 *   - The Flusher (design doc §7) will write pages one at a time to
 *     whichever slot it currently holds active, via
 *     wal_segment_pool_write_page(). When IT decides that segment is
 *     full ("if segment full: close segment, claim next SEG_FREE, open
 *     new segment" — its own decision, using its own cursor, not this
 *     module's job to predict), it calls wal_segment_pool_mark_done() to
 *     transition SEG_ACTIVE -> SEG_DONE, then wal_segment_pool_claim_next()
 *     for the next one. This module only supplies those primitives; the
 *     rollover *decision* and cursor bookkeeping belong to the Flusher
 *     phase, not here.
 *   - The Normal WAL Archiver (design doc §7) calls
 *     wal_segment_pool_read_segment() to get a whole segment's raw bytes
 *     in one call ("COPY PHASE: stream segment -> tmp/tmp_seg_<N>.mydb"
 *     copies the entire file, not page-by-page).
 *
 * Still no ring buffer, current_lsn, or TxnManager/PartitionCtx wiring —
 * this pool takes an explicit wal_dir path from its caller, the same
 * pattern DiskManager already uses for table files (storage_engine/
 * include/disk_manager.h), staying fully standalone.

 * like before this parameter existed.
 *
 * wal_segment_pool_write — the abstraction the Flusher actually calls.
 * This function does NOT parse or construct WalPageHeader content — the
 * Flusher's buf is a run of bytes copied straight out of ring-buffer
 * frames, which are already page-shaped (header + data, LSNs already
 * stamped inside — impl doc §8.6), except possibly its very first bytes,
 * which may be a bare continuation (no header) into a page whose header
 * was already written by an earlier call. Either way, this function is a
 * blind byte mover: it only knows page/segment *geometry*
 * (WAL_PAGE_SIZE, WAL_SEGMENT_PAGES_PER_FILE), never record content.
 *
 * slot_index, page_no, and offset are the Flusher's own cursor position
 * (its own {segment_no, page_no, offset, buf} — design doc §7's WalCursor
 * shape, minus lsn/buf which don't belong to this function's parameters),
 * passed in and updated in place: offset is the exact byte position
 * within page_no's 4096-byte slot to start writing at (this module never
 * reads a page back to "discover" that — the Flusher already knows it
 * from its own bookkeeping). On return, slot_index/page_no/offset name
 * where the *next* call should resume. The Flusher never computes page
 * or segment boundaries itself.
 *
 * Splits buf across as many pages as needed purely by byte count
 * (WAL_PAGE_SIZE per page-slot). When offset reaches WAL_PAGE_SIZE, that
 * page-slot is full: moves to the next page_no, or — if that was the
 * segment's last page-slot — auto-finalizes the segment and claims the
 * next one. The one exception to "never reads header content": right
 * before finalizing, reads the just-filled last page back
 * (wal_segment_pool_read_page + wal_page_header_deserialize) purely to
 * copy its end_lsn field into mark_done()'s end_lsn argument — the only
 * reliable source for a segment's true highest LSN, since start_lsn alone
 * is only the *first* record's LSN, not the last (see wal_page.h's
 * end_lsn field comment). This is a field copy, not content
 * interpretation. Returns MYDB_ERR if claim_next fails mid-write (pool
 * exhausted).
 *
 * TEMPORARY: fdatasyncs before returning on every call — the Flusher
 * exists now (wal_flusher.h) but calls this once per drained frame with
 * no batching of its own yet (design doc §11's group-commit isn't built),
 * so there's still no batching to fold this flush into. fdatasync, not
 * fsync: these files are posix_fallocate'd to a fixed size once and
 * never resized, so there's no essential size metadata for fdatasync to
 * need to flush beyond the data itself — avoids dragging the filesystem
 * journal into every flush on filesystems like ext4. This trailing fsync
 * always stays synchronous regardless of worker — it's the last thing
 * this call does, nothing left to overlap it with; only mark_done()'s
 * fsync (a different file) benefits from being offloaded. If worker was
 * given, waits on it (a cheap no-op if this call never rolled over)
 * before returning, so a caller with a worker still gets the same
 * "fully durable by the time this returns" guarantee as the no-worker
 * path. One line to remove once the Flusher batches multiple frames
 * behind one flush per cycle. */
